<h2 id="about-checkers">About Checkers</h2>
<h3 id="short-introduction">Short introduction</h3>
<p>Checkers is a software that performs denoising of cryo-scanning
transmission electron tomography (cryo-STET) datasets. Denoising is
performed using the noise2noise strategy^1^ implemented in cryo-CARE^2^.
This strategy uses a pair of images/volumes representing the same object
of interest, provided the noise in both images/volumes is different. In
conventional cryo-electron tomography, the image/volume pair is
generated using the odd and even frames of the movies collected using a
direct electron detector. Cryo-STET datasets do not contain odd and even
frames, they only consist of a single collected frame, thus the
image/volume pair must be generated post-acquisition. To generate such a
pair of images/volumes in cryo-STET, we have developed a new strategy
combining the software IMOD^3,4^, Tomo3D^5--7^ and MATLAB. In MATLAB,
the image pixels are split in two, i.e. the pixels with even coordinates
are separated from the pixels with odd coordinates. This generates two
different images where only some pixels contain information. To rebuild
the information in the blank pixels, we use a robust inpainting
algorithm^8,9^ as used in previous studies^10,11^. The pixel splitting
and inpainting computing steps are described in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Checkers currently runs in a bash script that executes all the steps,
calling the different software one after the other. We want to provide
the same workflow in a single Python or Jupyter Notebook script but we
do not know yet when this will be available.</p>
<p>Checkers was developed under Linux (CentOS Linux, Release 7 Kernel
3.10.0) on the Massive cluster (<a href="https://massive.org.au">https://massive.org.au</a>). Some of the
commands executed in Checkers are specific to Massive, however, if you
are not part of Massive you are still able to run Checkers. No
development of Windows or Mac version of Checkers is planned.</p>

<strong>Figure 1. Evolution of the image content during the splitting and inpainting steps of Checkers.</strong>
<strong>First row:</strong> A large field of view and a two-stage zoomed area focusing on gold beads
are included to better appreciate the image content after each computing
step. The input is a conventional image extracted from an aligned
cryo-STET tilt-series.
<strong>Second and third rows:</strong> After splitting the
pixels, two images are created, a first one composed of even coordinate
pixels only and a second one only containing the odd coordinate pixels.
In the large field of view, the odd and even images appear dark because
of the presence of black pixels (i.e., the ones that were not copied).
The moiré pattern is an optical illusion as can be observed in the zoom
images, the intensity of the remaining pixels is the same (actually
strictly the same) as that of the original ones.
<strong>Fourth and fifth rows:</strong> The inpainting step reconstructs the missing pixels, generating
two images that on the large field of view cannot be distinguished from
the original image, but at the highest zoom, differences can be
observed.
<strong>Extra information:</strong> Note that at the splitting step, only
half of the pixels are used as only pixels with coordinates (x-y) 1-1,
2-2, 1-3, 2-4, 1-5, 2-6, and so on, are kept. The reason for keeping
only half of the pixels is that this strategy produced higher-quality
denoised reconstructions. This has not been investigated further, but it
could be that adjacent pixels do not satisfy the noise independence
requirements because they share a certain amount of noise due to the
scanning of the electron beam (two adjacent pixels are collected
sequentially). Pixels diagonally adjacent are not collected sequentially
and they generate better denoised volumes.</p>
<h2 id="using-checkers">Using Checkers</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To run Checkers, several software must be pre-installed. We do not give
any guidelines on how to install them as this is very platform-specific.
These software are well-known and broadly used, you will find all the
necessary information online. On our cluster, Checkers runs smoothly
using this combination of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anaconda (Python 3.8 and gcc8)</li>
<li>Cuda 10.1</li>
<li>Cudnn 7.6.5 for Cuda 10.1</li>
<li>Imod 4.11.15</li>
<li>Matlab 2019</li>
<li>A cryoCARE environment installed in miniconda (we followed the
  manual installation described in here:
  <a href="https://github.com/juglab/cryoCARE_T2T">https://github.com/juglab/cryoCARE_T2T</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To run the MATLAB commands, you need to have some of the scripts we
use, and these files must be present inside the <em>computing directory</em>
(or in your MATLAB path):</p>
<ul>
<li>The collection of scripts to read/write MRC files, in particular
  <code>ReadMRC.m</code> and <code>WriteMRC.m</code>, available here:
  <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27021-imagic-mrc-dm-and-star-file-i-o">https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27021-imagic-mrc-dm-and-star-file-i-o</a></li>
<li>The <em>inpaintn.m</em> script to inpaint sparse images, available here:
  <a href="https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27994-inpaint-over-missing-data-in-1-d-2-d-3-d-nd-arrays">https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27994-inpaint-over-missing-data-in-1-d-2-d-3-d-nd-arrays</a></li>
<li>The file <code>splitPixels.m</code> is available in the <code>Scripts</code> folder of the
  GitHub Checkers page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main file, <em>Checkers.sh</em>, can be placed anywhere in your computer.
The idea behind that is that if you work on different projects
requiring different parameters, then you can have a <em>Checkers.sh</em> file
per project, allowing you to keep track of what you did.</p>
<h3 id="bash-script-setting-the-variables">Bash script: setting the variables</h3>
<p>At the top of the Checkers bash script, you will find several <code>module load</code>
commands. These commands are Massive-specific and are useful
only to people having access to the Massive data processing engine
<a href="https://massive.org.au">https://massive.org.au</a>.
If you are using a desktop computer, you
can simply delete these lines or comment them using a # in front of
the line.</p>
<p>Before running Checkers, you must set up a few variables that correspond to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing directory path</li>
<li>Data directory path</li>
<li>Tomo3D path</li>
<li>Thickness of the reconstruction</li>
<li>X/Y dimension of the tilt-series (only one value, we assume square images)</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose to have a <em>computing directory</em> AND a <em>data directory</em>
because in our workflow the directory where the <em>data</em> is stored has
either limited capacity, a slower connection, or both. By copying the
<em>data</em> to the <em>computing directory</em>, we avoid writing the intermediate
computed steps to the <em>data directory</em> and we run the computation on a
disk with faster disk access.</p>
<p>If your configuration or liking is to run the computation in the same
folder as where your data is located, then just enter the same path for
the <em>computing</em> and <em>data</em> directories.</p>
<p>The <em>tomo3dpath</em> is simply the path of Tomo3D bin folder on your
computer. We use Tomo3D for computing the 3D reconstructions. However,
if you prefer using IMOD for reconstructing your tomograms, please do
it.</p>
<p>The <em>thickness</em> variable represents how thick the reconstruction will be
in pixels. You should know more or less the value here.</p>
<h3 id="bash-script-actual-computation">Bash script: actual computation</h3>
<p>Checkers can process several tilt-series sequentially. This is performed
using a <code>for</code> loop that goes through the different tilt-series, checking
if the data actually exists, skipping non-existent data which is useful
when there are gaps in the tilt-series list. Our dataset always contains
a few tens of tilt-series, so by default we number the tilt-series using
3 digits. However, if you have more than a thousand tilt-series, it is
possible to use 4 digits, as indicated in the script.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the script, the user is asked to define the
coordinates of the region of interest for each tilt-series. There are at
least a couple of reasons why you should do that. First, in terms of
computing time, you do not want to perform the whole cryoCARE denoising
on the entire volume, especially if the sample does not fill it (which
is rarely the case). Using large volumes might cause <em>out-of-memory</em>
issues in cryoCARE and you might have to pick a greater number of volume
coordinates to more accurately train your model, which will
significantly increase the computation time. The second reason is that
in cryo-STET there are often large differences between the min and max
pixel values, because thick samples (e.g. entire bacteria) are observed
on a thin background (carbon support film). At the background level, the
intense beam experiences almost no scattering, hence all electrons are
collected on the STEM BF detector, generating a high-intensity pixel. At
the sample level, the scattering is important (especially at high tilt
angles), generating a low-intensity pixel. During the testing of
Checkers, we noticed that denoising works better on smaller 3D
reconstructions where the values of high-intensity and low-intensity
pixels are contained. Checkers uses an aligned tilt-series to generate
the denoised 3D reconstruction, then, you can relatively easily compute
a 3D reconstruction for each tilt-series and identify the 6 coordinates
(xStart, xStop, yStart, yStop, zStart, zStop) that define your area of
interest. Checkers will automatically compute the values that must be
given to the <code>newstack</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>TS</code> and <code>TF</code> variables represent the names of the aligned
tilt-series and tilt-angles, respectively. In Checkers, there is no
assumption on what the extension of your files should be, this is why
you need to provide the full filenames (except for the loop number). The
tilt-series must be already aligned, and it can have any file extension
(<code>.ali</code>, <code>.st</code>, <code>.mrc</code>, <code>.thisishowiliketonamemyfiles</code>, etc.) as long as
it is a file in the MRC format. The same goes for the tilt-angle file,
it just needs to be a single-column text file containing as many rows as
images contained in the tilt-series file, this convention is used by
many reconstruction algorithms (e.g. IMOD, Tomo3D). The convention we
use in the <code>Checkers.sh</code> file on GitHub is <code>.ali</code> and <code>.rawtlt</code> for the
aligned tilt-series and the tilt file, respectively; however, you can
change it to match your naming convention.</p>
<p>Checkers automatically copies the <em>data</em> from the <em>data directory</em> to
the <code>computing directory</code>. At the end of the script, it will also move
the final results to your <em>data directory</em>. A sub-folder <code>TS_001</code> is
also created and all intermediate steps will be written inside it, and
eventually deleted.</p>
<p>For better referencing the different computing steps performed in
Checkers, we have numbered them from <strong>01</strong> to <strong>10</strong> in the
<code>Checkers.sh</code> bash script. You might have to change some of the
commands if you want to do things slightly differently than us, and we
will let you know where to make those changes using the command
numbers. Note that these numbers do not correspond to the step numbers
described in the original publication of Checkers.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="command-01">Command 01</h4>
<p>This command starts the <em>splitPixels.m</em> MATLAB script
(no GUI displayed) which takes the input data and splits it into two
halved datasets. To be able to run this script, the MATLAB file
<em>splitPixels.m</em> must be in your <em>computing directory</em>, otherwise, MATLAB
won't find it. As previously mentioned, <em>ReadMRC.m</em>, <em>WriteMRC.m</em>,
<em>inpaintn.m,</em> etc. must also be in your <em>computing directory</em>. You can
also put them in your MATLAB path, and to load your path you must use
the <em>addpath(genpath(path))</em> command that is at the top of the
<em>splitPixels.m</em> script. By default, the path loading is disabled, but a
MATLAB experienced user might prefer having the path loaded instead of
needing to have the MATLAB scripts in the computing directory. You have
two options, choose the one you prefer. The command <strong>01</strong> also outputs
a log file (<em>matlab_output_splitPixels.txt</em>) which will contain useful
information if the command fails. The command <strong>01</strong> outputs two
tilt-series named <em>TS_001a_DTC.mrc</em> and <em>TS_001b_DTC.mrc</em>, which will be
used in the following part of the Checkers script.</p>
<h4 id="commands-02a-and-02b">Commands 02a and 02b</h4>
<p>The volumes corresponding to the two
inpainted tilt-series are reconstructed with Tomo3D. The output is a
volume with the XZ plane facing us. At this step, if you want to use
IMOD instead, just change the commands accordingly. You will need to
replace the commands <strong>02a</strong> and <strong>02b</strong> with something like "<em>tilt
-input -output -TILTFILE -THICKNESS etc.</em>"</p>
<h4 id="commands-03a-and-03b">Commands 03a and 03b</h4>
<p>Since the output of the previous command
is a rotated volume, we need to rotate it in the right orientation so we
can explore the data more easily. <em>Trimvol</em> is an IMOD command, and the <em>-rx</em>
option rotates the volume around the X axis, so we have a volume with
the XY plane facing us.</p>
<h4 id="commands-04a-and-04b">Commands 04a and 04b</h4>
<p>The <em>newstack</em> command from IMOD is used
to crop the volumes according to the ROI coordinates defined above in
the script. The <em>-secs</em> option lets you choose what slices of the volume
you want to keep. With the <em>-size</em> option, you set X and Y sizes of the
output reconstruction. And with the <em>-offset</em> option, you set the centre
of the output reconstruction (0,0 means that the input and output
reconstructions will share the same centre). All of this is already
taken care of by Checkers. If you do not want to crop your
reconstruction, just comment the <em>newstack</em> commands <strong>04a</strong> and <strong>04b</strong>
with a #, it will still work.</p>
<h4 id="command-05">Command 05</h4>
<p>Delete temporary files.</p>
<h4 id="command-06">Command 06</h4>
<p>This command is to load the cryocare conda environment.
The first line (<em>source /my/path/to/...</em>) consists of loading miniconda.
The second line (<em>module load cryocare)</em> is loading the cryoCARE
environment. You will need to input the right path.</p>
<h4 id="command-07">Command 07</h4>
<p>This is the 1^st^ cryoCARE command which generates the
data for further training of the model. Here we use the following
parameters (as in train_data_config.json from cryoCARE_pip):</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of train volumes = 1200</li>
<li>Number of validation volumes = 120</li>
<li>Volume dimensions = 72,72,72</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters were not particularly optimised. Feel free to change
them if they do not suit you or if you think you can achieve better
denoising.</p>
<h4 id="command-08">Command 08</h4>
<p>This is the 2^nd^ cryoCARE command which trains the
neural network model. We use the following parameters (as in
train_config.json from cryoCARE_pip):</p>
<ul>
<li>Train loss = mse</li>
<li>Number of training epochs = 100</li>
<li>Number of training steps per epoch = 200</li>
<li>U-net depth = 3</li>
<li>U-net first layer size = 16</li>

<p>Again, these parameters were not particularly optimised. Feel free to
change them if they do not suit you or if you think you can achieve
better denoising.</p>

<p>This is the 3^rd^ and last cryoCARE command which
applies the trained model to the data.</p>
<h4 id="command-10">Command 10</h4>
<p>The final data, including the denoised tomogram, the
cryoCARE <code>config.json</code> file, the computed model weights and the Matlab log
are moved to the <em>data directory</em>.</p>
